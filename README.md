# FPL UX Enhancer

A Chrome extension that enhances the UX/UI of the Fantasy Premier League website with custom styles and some features for Transfer and Pick Team tabs.

## How to install

1. Download a .zip file of this repository (click `Code` button and select `Download ZIP`)
2. Unpack ZIP anywhere on your device
3. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
4. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner
5. Click "Load unpacked" and select the directory where you unpacked the extension
6. The extension icon should now appear in your Chrome toolbar
7. Visit [Fantasy Premier League](https://fantasy.premierleague.com/) to see the enhancements

## Changes list

1. Reducing the size of the elements, so that the "Pick Team" and "Transfers" view is on the laptop screen (~1680px width).
2. Changing the order of columns (moved panel to the right side).
3. The sticky panel on the transfer list with internal scroll on, so that the team view is always visible when scrolling the list of players.
4. Clicking on a player's card immediately opens an extended pop-up with information ("Full Profile" version).

## Disclaimers

1. The extension may stop working properly if the website authors release any update. If the extension doesn't work correctly, disable it.
2. The extension is not available in the Chrome Web Store, because why pay $5 to put it there when the site authors will soon improve the UX themselves (right? xd).
3. All source files are included in the repository so you can verify that you are not installing any malware.
4. I know the styles look like crap, but I couldn't decide whether to target CSS classes (and risk having it completely break when the developers upload a new build) or the structure. Ultimately, I ended up with a mix.
